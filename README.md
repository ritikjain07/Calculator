The Calculator Project is a web-based application that brings together HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly and functional calculator. This project aims to provide a simple yet powerful tool for users to perform basic arithmetic operations with ease.

The user interface is designed for optimal user experience, featuring a clean layout with digit buttons (0-9), a decimal point (.), and operators (+, -, *, /). A prominent display at the top keeps users informed about their input and the calculated result. The calculator's responsiveness ensures seamless functionality across various devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

The project's core functionality revolves around the implementation of arithmetic operations. JavaScript is utilized to handle dynamic input, allowing users to interact with the calculator by clicking on buttons. The display updates in real-time, providing instant feedback on the entered digits and operators. Chaining operations is supported, enabling users to perform multiple calculations in sequence.

To enhance the user experience, error handling is implemented to prevent invalid inputs or operations. Informative messages guide users in case of division by zero or other potential errors. Clear (C) buttons facilitate both resetting the input for a new calculation and correcting mistakes by removing the last entered digit or operator.

The equals (=) button triggers the evaluation of the entered expression, displaying the calculated result on the calculator's screen. Styling is a crucial aspect of the project, and CSS is employed to create an attractive and visually appealing design. Consideration is given to animations and transitions to further enhance the overall look and feel.

The implementation steps involve setting up the HTML structure, applying CSS styles, and writing JavaScript functions to handle user interactions and arithmetic operations. Thorough testing ensures the calculator's accuracy and responsiveness. Finally, the calculator can be deployed on a web server or hosted on platforms like GitHub Pages, making it accessible to users globally.

In conclusion, the Calculator Project provides a hands-on experience in web development, allowing developers to apply fundamental concepts while creating a practical and interactive tool for users.
